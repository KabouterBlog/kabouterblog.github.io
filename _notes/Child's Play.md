After I got stuck on my issues with TTRPG combat, I found [this](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/11/the-inn-between.html) blog post by Goblin Punch that really got me going. It sent me down the rabbit hole of "romantic" games (not lovey-dovey romance, but [romantic in the artistic sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism)). I really liked the approach taken with the [Goose-Gold & Goblins](http://falsemachine.blogspot.com/2020/05/soft-ass-d.html) posts, but I wanted to try my own hand at the mechanics. If we are going to take direct, physical combat out of an RPG, a large chunk of the mechanics and game-play loops are now gone. Weapons and armor, a lot of spells (maybe not so much the OSR style ones), maybe even HP now have lost their purpose, so it would be nice to replace them.

## Mechanical Preferences

I have a few ideas of the general mechanical direction I want to go in, but am willing to explore other options as well.

Most of my past experience has been with "D20, roll over" systems (5e, Knave), but I would prefer to cut down on the math. The "D20, roll under" system is also very popular in the OSR/NSR space, and while I have not played Into the Odd or any of the Odd-ish games I very much would like to. I also like the character stats being a form of long-term HP as well as the roll target, meaning as you encounter more setbacks, things get more difficult. So maybe I might move in that direction.

I have recently read through the [Errant](https://killjestergames.itch.io/errant) ruleset, and I really like the idea of having procedures for different actions in the game. I find some of the rules a bit too crunchy for my liking, but some other, "softer" sections are brilliant; I especially love the rules for languages! 

I have not played any dice pool games, but I am open to new things.

Maybe all this talk of dice is a bit premature. I don't even know what the characters would be doing! Lets focus on that first, rules can come later.

## Inspiration

My first instinct is to turn to other forms of media that I want to get the "feel" of in this new project and analyze them for similarities and tropes. To this extent, I have been developing an [[Appendix N|Appendix N]] to be a source of inspiration. A very common theme in almost all of these works is "little person on big adventure". While not all of the protagonists are literal children, a lot of them are, and even when they are not the power dynamics at play put them at a large disadvantage: brute force is not an option for them.
I have compiled a short list of "verbs" off of the top of my head from what I remember from these works:

- Hide
- Seek
- Run/Escape
- Explore/discover
- Solve puzzle/riddle
- Make friends

I would like to then go back to some of these works and take notes:

- Do these verbs make sense? Are there any I missed or any changes I would make?
- How long does each "loop" take? Is it an encounter, session or multi-session activity?
- What are the inciting incidents? Is it driven by the characters or by outside forces?
- What are the rewards? Are the characters gaining anything, or just recouping lost ground/preventing loss (progress or defense)?

I am sure this will be expanded a lot during the process, so I will try my hand at a few reviews and will formulize the above more formally when I have a better grasp on my goals.
