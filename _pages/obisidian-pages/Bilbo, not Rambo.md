The party was tasked with infiltrating the sprawling mansion of an eccentric recluse and stealing the family snake of a local noble-woman. We were playing a roguish city campaign (5e game, homebrew setting), where the PCs were all on the _other_ side of the law, so maybe I should not have been surprised with how things went, but I was.

The heist started about as I expected it would. The location was scoped from multiple angles: the bard got inside by pretending to make an appointment to borrow a book from the private library, trying to glean as much information from the secretary as possible, while the rogue went down all of the alley-ways around the sprawling building looking for an alternative way in. What I was not prepared for was how the rest of the execution of the plan went.

The party waited till night, snuck in through a top-floor window, and proceeded to SWAT their way through the "dungeon" one level at a time. Through some great strategy and greater rolls, they managed to clear out nearly every room without raising any alarms, killing anything that moved (including the noble resident himself, a powerful mage that just didn't see it coming), and taking loot on their way down through to the secret basement. They found the hydra that was being kept captive in the subterranean vivarium, where it was decapitated daily and the skin used to scry on political rivals (what was supposed to be the final boss), but since it was not the mark, the squad found a way to sneak past, grab the much smaller snake they were sent to retrieve, and left the manor-cum-slaughterhouse behind them as they slipped into the dark streets below.

The players seemed to have a wonderful time! The power trip of encountering and then very quickly and efficiently dispatching everything I threw at them seemed to give them no end of joy, and overall the two sessions were a major success. But, to be honest, I was unhappy. I was very happy to see the players planning ahead and seriously engaging with what I had prepared, but something was stuck in my teeth, and I could not work it out. It would take nearly two years, a completely different game (different setting, players, even ruleset) before I worked out what it was.

### Missing the mark

The second encounter of the evening (OSR home-brewed run through Curse of Strahd) was going just about as planned. Two of the players were having fun trying out their new magic weapons they recently got, dispatching foes left and right, but the third was having a rough time. The RNG gods were just not smiling on him that evening, and every swing at a twig-blight ended with no roll being higher than an 8. By the end of the encounter, the other two had dispatched maybe two dozen enemies together, while he had only managed to hit twice. It sucked.

It was only then that I realized what had been bothering me about the previous game so much. There was perhaps only one roll that did not go the way the players were expecting.

Back then, during one of the combats it was the rogue's turn:
> Player: "I charge towards the demon and attack with my daggers." Rolls to hit. "$#&% I rolled a 2."
> 
> Me: "That is a miss, the demon ducks out from under you, your swing going wide over its head. It turns to you and snarls, baring its large, dripping fangs at at you. Do you have any bonus actions?"
> 
> Player: "Nope, and I used all my movement to get there, so I guess I am done"
> 
> Me: "Okay, the demon is next up..."

It is so small, and it happens all the time! They missed one attack, so what? The problem wasn't the miss, necessarily, but the mood shift it caused. The player in question was a great strategist, loved to plan and ask a thousand questions, treating every flowery description as a well of clues to be scrutinized. Up to this point in the session they were the star of the show, but after that one miss they suddenly withdrew. For the next few encounters they played it safe, slow, and did not engage much at all. Of course they recovered and continued as normal, but that brief, 30 minute dead air bothered me in a way I did not fully process. Why was this such a problem for them? What happened?

If I were to ask them now, they probably would have no memory of the session at all, let alone that one miss, but if I were take a guess as to what happened, I would say that when the image they had in their mind of their character, Mission Impossible-ing their way through this fortress, was suddenly stripped away as they just stood there like a mook, they were completely pulled out of the narrative. The lost momentum stopped them dead in their tracks.

This is obviously me projecting and reading too deeply into it, but for some reason I just could not come to terms with how crappy it is to try to do something and then fail in the most boring way possible. There are hundreds of rule sets out there (at least!) and quite a few I have read have tried to rectify this part of combat. Some have a sliding scale of success, trying to make failure interesting by having many levels of failure, while some take out the to-hit rule altogether. While I would like to try out some of these in the near future, my brain started going off in a different direction altogether: why combat?

Part of what made that first session so strange for me was not actually the one player sulking for a bit, but rather the whole way the party approached the session. While I was thinking of the world building, the NPC motivations, the set dressing, the players were thinking of numbers: hit points, loot values, spell slots remaining. It was like they were playing a completely different game to the previous session, and in a way they were.

I grew up on fantasy. My mother read The Hobbit and the Narnia books to us as a bedtime story when I was quite young, along with many other wonderful stories, and that is where a lot of my love for the genre springs from. The friends I was playing with in that first game (brothers and their partners) were also big fans of fantasy, but they were raised on Raymond E. Feist and Glen Cook (both of whom I love, but only read much later in life). I think that, fundamentally, when I thought of sneaking about in enemy territory, I was thinking of Bilbo in Mirkwood, keeping quiet and trying to free his friends so they can all run away, while they were thinking of the squad in "Predator", heavily armed and ready for blood.

To be fair to them, 5e _does_ lend itself much more heavily to the latter, being much more about heroic fantasy than the more OSR-type games I tend to gravitate towards now. But maybe that is exactly _why_ that one miss felt so wrong. "I am Rambo, why am I just standing here in the open?"

### Why are we fighting?

This has lead me to rethink the games I am running now, and think about what kind of stories I want to tell. In the stories of my childhood the heroes did wave around swords occasionally, yes, but most of the time that was the last resort. Most of the story would be about the journey, the people, and maybe only have a battle at the climax. In Bilbo's case, he wasn't even present at the final battle against Smaug!

I think that maybe it might be helpful (and even fun!) to try to find a way to have a "Hobbit" type of game, rather than a "Lord of the Rings" Aragorn and co., battle-hardened adventure. [[Child's Play|Can I make a game where combat just isn't present, while still keeping it feeling "fantasy"?]]
